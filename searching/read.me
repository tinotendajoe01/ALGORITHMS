Search algorithms are used to search for items in a data structure, such as an array or a linked list. They are used to find specific items or to determine if an item is present in the data structure.

The most common search algorithm is linear search, which searches through each item in the data structure one at a time until it finds the desired item. Here is an example of linear search written in JavaScript:


 Another popular search algorithm is binary search, which works by dividing the data structure into two halves and searching one half at a time. This algorithm requires that the data structure be sorted before it can be searched. Here is an example of binary search written in JavaScript:
