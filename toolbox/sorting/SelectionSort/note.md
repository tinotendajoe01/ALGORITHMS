Imagine that you have a bunch of toys in your room, and you want to arrange them in order from smallest to largest. You decide to use selection sort to do this.

First, you start by finding the smallest toy in your room. You pick it up and set it aside.

Next, you find the next smallest toy and put it next to the first toy.

You continue this process for all the toys, finding the next smallest toy and adding it to the sorted section of toys.

In JavaScript, we can write a selection sort algorithm like this:

function selectionSort(arr) {
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) { // Loop through the array from the first element to the second-to-last.
let minIndex = i; // Set the minimum index to the current index.
for (let j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++) { // Loop through the array from the next element to the last.
if (arr[j] < arr[minIndex]) { // If the current element is smaller than the minimum element...
minIndex = j; // Set the minimum index to the current index.
}
}
let tmp = arr[i]; // Store the current element in a temporary variable.
arr[i] = arr[minIndex]; // Replace the current element with the minimum element.
arr[minIndex] = tmp; // Replace the minimum element with the temporary variable (the original current element).
}
return arr; // Return the sorted array.
}
So, just like with your toys, this algorithm goes through the array of numbers and finds the smallest number. It then swaps that number with the first number in the array. It repeats this process for each subsequent number until the entire array is sorted in ascending order.
