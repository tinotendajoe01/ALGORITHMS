Imagine that you have a bunch of Lego blocks in your room, and you want to arrange them in order from smallest to largest. You decide to use merge sort to do this.

First, you start by dividing your Lego blocks into two equal piles.

Next, you sort each pile separately using merge sort. You do this by dividing each pile into two equal piles and sorting each of those separately. You continue dividing and sorting until each pile has only one block, which is already considered "sorted".

Then, you merge the two sorted piles back together, comparing the first block of each pile and putting the smaller one first. You continue this process, comparing the next two blocks of each pile and putting the smaller one first, until you have merged the entire pile back together in order.
