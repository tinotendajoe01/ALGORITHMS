Imagine that you have a bunch of toys in your room, and you want to arrange them in order from smallest to largest. You decide to use quicksort to do this.

First, you pick a toy from the pile and call it the "pivot". This can be any toy, but let's say you pick the first toy in the pile.

Next, you divide the remaining toys into two piles: one pile of toys that are smaller than the pivot, and one pile of toys that are larger than the pivot.

Then, you repeat the process recursively for each of the two piles, picking a new pivot and dividing the remaining toys into two piles again
