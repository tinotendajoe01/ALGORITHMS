/**
 here's an example of how to implement a recursive solution to find the n-th Fibonacci number using divide and conquer:
 */
function fibonacci(n) {
  if (n <= 1) {
    return n; // Base case: return 0 for n = 0 and 1 for n = 1.
  } else {
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2); // Recursive case: return the sum of the previous two Fibonacci numbers.
  }
}
/**
Here's how this function works:

We start by checking if n is less than or equal to 1. If it is, we return n as the base case. This is because the first two Fibonacci numbers are 0 and 1, and we can't calculate the previous two numbers for n = 0 and n = 1.

If n is greater than 1, we use the recursive case to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. This involves calling the fibonacci() function recursively with n - 1 and n - 2 as arguments, and returning the sum of the results.

The recursive calls continue until we reach the base case, at which point we start returning values and summing them up to get the final result.

So, for example, if we call fibonacci(6), the function will return 8, since the 6th Fibonacci number is 8 (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8). However, note that this recursive implementation has exponential time complexity, which means that it can be very slow for large values of n.
