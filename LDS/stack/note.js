// Imagine you have a pile of books. You can only take the top book off the pile at any given time. This is similar to how a stack works in programming.

// In JavaScript, a stack is a data structure that stores information in a specific way. When you add something to the stack, it goes on top of everything else that's already there. When you remove something from the stack, you can only remove the top item.

// Here's an example: let's say we have a stack of numbers in JavaScript. We start with an empty stack:

```
let myStack = [];
```// We can add numbers to the stack using the `push()` method:

```
myStack.push(1);
myStack.push(2);
myStack.push(3);
```// Now our stack looks like this:

```
[3, 2, 1]
```// Notice how `3` is on top because it was added last.

// We can remove items from the top of the stack using the `pop()` method:

```
let removedItem = myStack.pop();
console.log(removedItem); // prints 3
console.log(myStack); // prints [2, 1]
```// Now our stack looks like this:

```
[2, 1]
```;

// And `3` has been removed from the top.

// That's basically how a stack works in JavaScript! It's just like a pile of books where you can only take off the top one at any given time.
