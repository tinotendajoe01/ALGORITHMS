Imagine you're waiting in line for your turn on a slide at the playground. The first person in line goes down the slide, and then they get out of the way so that the next person can go. Then the second person goes down, and so on until everyone has had their turn.

A queue is like that line at the playground. It's a list of things (or people) waiting for their turn to do something. In JavaScript, we can use a queue to keep track of things we need to do in order.

When we add something to a queue, it goes to the end of the line. And when we take something out of a queue, we take it from the front of the line - just like how the first person in line at the playground goes down the slide first.

So that's what a queue is - it's just a list of things waiting for their turn, where new things get added to one end and old things get taken out from the other end!

A queue is a linear data structure where the data flows in a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) manner.
