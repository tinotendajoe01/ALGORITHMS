Imagine that you have a bunch of friends, and you want to draw a picture that shows who is friends with who. You could draw a bunch of circles (which we call "nodes" or "vertices") to represent each friend, and then draw lines (which we call "edges") between the circles to show who is friends with who.

That picture you drew is called a "graph"! Graphs are a way to show how different things are connected to each other. You can use graphs to show anything that has connections between different parts, like social networks, road maps, or computer networks.

Graphs can look really different depending on what you're using them for. For example, a social network graph might have circles for each person and lines between them to show who is friends with who. A road map graph might have circles for each city and lines between them to show the roads that connect them. And a computer network graph might have circles for each computer or server and lines between them to show how they're connected together.

The cool thing about graphs is that they can help you figure out things that might be hard to see just by looking at the individual parts. For example, if you wanted to figure out the shortest route between two cities on a road map, you could use a graph to help you find it! You could start at one city and follow the lines (roads) to get to the other city, and then count how many lines (roads) you took to get there.

So, a graph is a way to show how different things are connected to each other, and it can help you figure out things that might be hard to see just by looking at the individual parts.
