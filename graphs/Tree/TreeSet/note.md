A Tree Set is like a special type of collection in JavaScript where you can store a bunch of values, but they are always sorted in a certain way. Imagine you had a bunch of toys that you wanted to keep in a box, but you wanted to keep them sorted by size. You could use a Tree Set to do that!

Here's how it works: when you add a new toy to the Tree Set, it figures out where it should go based on its size. If it's smaller than a toy that's already in the set, it goes to the left of that toy. If it's bigger, it goes to the right. This way, all the toys are always sorted by size and you can easily find the smallest or biggest toy in the set.

The cool thing about a Tree Set is that it's really fast to look up a toy in the set. If you want to see if a certain toy is in the set, you don't have to look at every single toy to find it. Instead, the Tree Set uses a special technique called "binary search" to quickly find the toy you're looking for.

So, a Tree Set is like a special box that keeps your toys sorted by size and makes it easy to find a toy when you need it.
