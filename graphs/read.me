Breadth-First Search (BFS):
Breadth-First Search is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes first, before moving to the next level neighbors.



   
Depth-First Search (DFS):   
Depth-First Search is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. The DFS algorithm traverses down a path, one level at a time, until it reaches a leaf node or a dead end before backtracking to explore other paths in the tree/graph structure.
