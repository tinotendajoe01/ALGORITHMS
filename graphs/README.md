## GraphsDSA

This folder contains code and examples for different types of graph and tree data structures and algorithms. Let's begin!

# Graphs

Graphs are like a collection of dots (called nodes) connected by lines (called edges). We can use different algorithms to travel from one dot to another. Two popular algorithms are:

# Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Imagine you are playing a game where you start at the center dot and want to visit all the dots around it. With BFS, you would visit all the dots at the same level (distance from the center) before moving to the next level. This is also called Level Order Traversal. It's like visiting all your friends on the same street before going to the next street.

# Depth-First Search (DFS)

DFS is another way to visit all the dots. Instead of visiting all the dots at the same level first, you would visit a dot and then its closest neighbor, and then that neighbor's closest neighbor, and so on. It's like exploring a maze by following one path until you reach a dead end, then backtracking and trying another path.

# Trees

Trees are a special type of graph where each dot (node) can have at most one line (edge) connecting it to another dot above it (parent) and multiple lines connecting it to dots below it (children). Here are some types of trees:

# Binary Search Tree (BST)

A BST is a tree where each dot has at most two children dots. The left child dot has a smaller value than the parent dot, and the right child dot has a larger value than the parent dot. It's like organizing your toys in a pyramid, where smaller toys are on the left and larger toys are on the right.

# Balanced Binary Tree (BTT)

A BTT is a BST that is balanced, which means that the height of the tree (the number of levels) is as small as possible. This helps to find dots faster. It's like organizing your toys in a balanced pyramid so that you can find them more easily.

# TreeMap

A TreeMap is a type of tree that stores key-value pairs in a sorted order based on their keys. It's like a dictionary where you can find the meaning of a word (value) by searching for the word itself (key).

# Tree Search

Tree Search is the process of finding a specific dot (node) in a tree by using different algorithms, like BFS or DFS. It's like searching for a specific toy in your toy pyramid.

I hope this helps you understand the basics of graphs and trees! Feel free to explore the code and examples in this folder. Happy coding!
